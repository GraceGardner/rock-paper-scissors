## Abstract  
This project is my take on classic and advanced Rock Paper Scissors. The goal was to allow the user to play against a computer, which then randomly selects a fighter to compete against the user's selected fighter. The results of the game are displayed, and the scores tracked.

## Project Specs  

The user is given the choice of Mouse, Elephant and Cat for the classic game. When the user wins, their choice of fighter is shown celebrating; when the user looses, their fighter is shown under a sad rain cloud. Each time the user selects a fighter the user's icon appears under their choice for a moment.

The user is also able to change which game they are playing by pressing the change game button.

User can also choose to play the difficult game with five fighters to choose from; Mouse, Elephant, Cat, Ferret and Cucumber.
